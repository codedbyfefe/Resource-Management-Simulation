##  What Is This Game?

Barter Farm is a 2D farming simulation prototype where **thereâ€™s no money** â€” just **trading**.

Players grow crops, raise livestock, and **barter** with NPCs to expand and manage their farm. Instead of using traditional currency, you trade goods directly, making every decision more strategic.

- Start with a small pack of seeds and a couple of chickens  
- Plant, harvest, store, and trade resources  
- Handle random events that can disrupt your plans  
- Upgrade your farm to improve efficiency  
- Define your own goals â€” no fixed endgame
